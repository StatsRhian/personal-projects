1. Made a good start by making the questionnaire, and advertising the event. Got overwhelmed with other work.
In December I will contact the organisers, choose a date in Jan, and kick it off fully in January. 
2. Applying for CStat status. Spent one afternoon updating my CPD. This is a job for January
3. Had 5 good climbs, despite a busy November. 
4. Success! After many viewings we managed to get an offer accepted. Fingers crossed! :house_with_garden:
