# February 2019 :house_with_garden:

February was pretty hectic, to the point where I didn't even get around to setting any goals. 
However, we did manage to move house and I got a new job so it was pretty successful!

# January 2019 :green_book:

1. That's Lyth :runner:
2. CPD Development Plan :green_book:
3. Get cycle fit :bike:

---

1. This was a great success. We managed two recees, the race day went brilliantly and I got around in 5:59.
2. I didn't do any CPD development. Now that I'm moving jobs, I'll push this to May
3. We got out a decent amount on the bike, but some more rides and maintainance required.

# December 2018 :christmas_tree:

1. Running Everyday :runner:
2. Writing talk for Florence Nightingale Day
3. Preparing for R-Ladies in January

---

1. Success! I ran all 25 days, totally 120km.
2. This went well, although I ended up writing the majority of it in January...
3. This has not happened again. I think I need to just book in a date.

# November 2018 :fireworks:

1. Setting up R-Ladies Lancaster.
2. Applying for CStat status

1. Made a good start by making the questionnaire, and advertising the event. Got overwhelmed with other work.
In December I will contact the organisers, choose a date in Jan, and kick it off fully in January. 
2. Applying for CStat status. Spent one afternoon updating my CPD. This is a job for January
3. Had 5 good climbs, despite a busy November. 
4. Success! After many viewings we managed to get an offer accepted. Fingers crossed! :house_with_garden:
