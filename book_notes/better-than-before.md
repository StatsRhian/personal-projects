## Four pillars of habit formation

* :chart_with_upwards_trend: Monitor 
* :calendar: Schedule 

* :couple: Accountability
* :trophy: Strong foundation habits

## Getting Started

* First steps

  * :clock10: Start now
  * :footprints: Small steps
  * :rocket: Blast start

## Effort

### Strategy of Convenience

  * Make cues
  * Decrease physical effort
  * Clothes ready for a run

### Strategy of Inconvenience

* Hide cues
* Increased physical effort
* Add financial cost
* Incompatible activity
* Delay email after 11
* Block it

### Strategy of Abstaining

Are you an abstainer or a moderator?

## :snake: Avoiding temptation
### Safeguards

  * If then planning
  * Be kind to yourself
  * Don't let a stumble become a fall - "What the hell"
  * Planned exception (not spur of the moment)

### Loophole spotting

  * This doesn't count
  * False choice (A or B)
  * Lack of control
  * Fake self-actualisation "It's a special day" special day
  * Question assumption  it isn't worth bothering with
  * Plan to fail
  * Tomorrow logic
  * Moral license - we deserve a break
  * One coin
  * Concern for others

### Distraction

## Pleasure
### Rewards

* :checkered_flag: Finish line can be dangerous
* Extrinsic

* Intrinsic 
  * Recognition
  * Fantasy
  * Competition
  * Challenge
  * Control
  * Co-operative

### Treats

* Avoid food, shopping and screen time as treats
* Just because
* Plan your menu 

### Pairing

* Can be good (podcast with running)
* Can be bad (Buy a nibble when food shopping)

 ### Clarity

When thinking about habits, pairs of conflicts arise. E.g  "I want to save money & I want to go to the gym". Having clear values and clear actions can help resolve these conflicts.

* Clarity of Values
     * Red herring habit "I want to be vegan"

* Clarity of Action
     * Bright line rule ("I don't buy make up")
     * Your identity is strong
